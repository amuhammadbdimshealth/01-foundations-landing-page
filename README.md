- [ ] Header logo should be an image instead of a text
- [✔️] css object-fit: cover;
    - The CSS property object-fit: cover; is used to control how an image or video is resized and positioned within its container. When applied to an element, such as an <img> or <video> tag, it ensures that the content (image or video) maintains its aspect ratio while covering the entire available space of the container.
